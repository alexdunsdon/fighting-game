  PIXEL BRAWL - Roblox Studio Setup Guide
=====================================================

This guide walks you through setting up the fighting
game in Roblox Studio step by step.

=====================================================
STEP 1: Open Roblox Studio
=====================================================
- Open Roblox Studio
- Create a new Baseplate place (or empty place)
- Delete the default Baseplate part (the arena is
  created automatically by the server script)

=====================================================
STEP 2: Add the Shared Module
=====================================================
Location: ReplicatedStorage

1. In the Explorer panel, right-click "ReplicatedStorage"
2. Click Insert Object > ModuleScript
3. Rename it to "FightConfig"
4. Open FightConfig.lua from the roblox/ReplicatedStorage/ folder
5. Copy ALL the code and paste it into the ModuleScript

=====================================================
STEP 3: Add the Server Script
=====================================================
Location: ServerScriptService

1. In the Explorer panel, right-click "ServerScriptService"
2. Click Insert Object > Script
3. Rename it to "FightServer"
4. Open FightServer.server.lua from roblox/ServerScriptService/
5. Copy ALL the code and paste it into the Script

=====================================================
STEP 4: Add the Client Script
=====================================================
Location: StarterPlayer > StarterPlayerScripts

1. In the Explorer panel, expand "StarterPlayer"
2. Right-click "StarterPlayerScripts"
3. Click Insert Object > LocalScript
4. Rename it to "FightClient"
5. Open FightClient.client.lua from roblox/StarterPlayerScripts/
6. Copy ALL the code and paste it into the LocalScript

=====================================================
STEP 5: Add the HUD Script
=====================================================
Location: StarterGui

1. In the Explorer panel, right-click "StarterGui"
2. Click Insert Object > LocalScript
3. Rename it to "FightHUD"
4. Open FightHUD.client.lua from roblox/StarterGui/
5. Copy ALL the code and paste it into the LocalScript

=====================================================
STEP 6: Test It!
=====================================================

TO TEST WITH 2 PLAYERS (recommended):
1. In Roblox Studio, go to the "Test" tab
2. Click the dropdown next to "Play" and select
   "Start" (server + 2 clients)
   OR set "Players" to 2 and click "Start"
3. Two client windows will open
4. Both players are auto-queued and matched
5. Use the controls below to fight!

TO TEST SOLO (just to see the waiting screen):
1. Click "Play" (single player)
2. You'll see the "Waiting for opponent..." screen
3. You need a second player to start a match

=====================================================
CONTROLS
=====================================================

  Action      Keys
  --------    -------------------------
  Move Left   A or Left Arrow
  Move Right  D or Right Arrow
  Jump        W or Up Arrow or Space
  Block       S or Down Arrow (hold)
  Punch       F or Q
  Kick        G or E
  Special     H or R

=====================================================
HOW IT WORKS
=====================================================

- Players auto-join a matchmaking queue on spawn
- When 2 players are queued, a match begins
- 3-second countdown, then FIGHT!
- Health bars, 60-second timer, best of 3 rounds
- K.O. when health reaches 0, or most health at
  timeout wins the round
- Winner of 2 rounds wins the match
- After match, players return to queue automatically

=====================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
=====================================================

"Nothing happens when I play"
- Make sure you're testing with 2 players
  (Test > Start with 2 players)
- Check Output window for "[PixelBrawl]" messages

"Characters don't move right"
- The server controls character positions
- Make sure FightConfig is a ModuleScript (not Script)
- Check that all scripts are in the correct locations

"HUD doesn't show"
- FightHUD must be a LocalScript in StarterGui
- Check Output for errors

"Camera is wrong"
- FightClient handles camera. Make sure it's a
  LocalScript in StarterPlayerScripts
